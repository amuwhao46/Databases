Alfred- Mostly focuesed on implementing the hotUserItems (Big Creator, Hot NFT, Common NFT, etc) in the backend. Performed numerous error handling and code checking in mysqlworkbench to ensure it runs smoothly. Tried to diagnose and find out why the errors were happening. Made the DAO for the hotUser's, and implemented the diamond/paperhand and inactive users into the respective NFT/User DAO.

Oke- Implemented the tables in the front end to display the information. Worked on the Statistics DAO, and routing for statistics in the back and front end. Rewriting error handling systems and scanning through each line to debug and ensure everything works correctly in the backend and frontend. Statistics and common NFT were able to work.

We spent ~30 hours working collaboratively on this part of the project. 

In order to run our project, we recommend you install eclipse. You will want to ensure the properties of the project have a recent version of Java, Dynamic Web Module, 
and JavaScript. It is also important that in your java Build Path, you have JRE System Library (your version), Server runtime(recent apache tomcat), web app libraries, and EAR Libraries all checked off. Then you will want to run the code by first running "register.jsp" on your tomcat server and registering a user then logging in. If you are looking for administrative actions and an overview of the currently listed NFT's, you must log into the root user.
