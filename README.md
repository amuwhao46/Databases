We spent ~19 hours working collaboratively. Designing our Relational model, ER Diagram, and actually implementing the code. 

In order to run our project, we recommend you install eclipse. You will want to ensure the properties of the project have a recent version of Java, Dynamic Web Module, 
and JavaScript. It is also important that in your java Build Path, you have JRE System Library (your version), Server runtime(recent apache tomcat), web app libraries, 
and EAR Libraries all checked off. Then you will want to run the code by first running "register.jsp" on your tomcat server and registering a user then logging in. If 
you are looking for administrative actions, you must log into the root user.
